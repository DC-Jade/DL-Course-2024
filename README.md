## News and Updates

[2024-04-010] Assignments hw01-hw07 and hw11 are available. Slides of lecture01-lecture03 and 06 are updated.


## Prerequisites and Materials

- We will be using Numpy and PyTorch in this class, so you will need to be able to program in Python.

- You might need familiarity with essential calculus (differentiation, chain rule), linear algebra, and basic probability.

- You might supplement or expand some knowledge of deep learning through courses online, e.g., [LeeDL-Tutorial](https://github.com/datawhalechina/leedl-tutorial).


## Course Work

- **Weekly Homeworks** (20%)
  - There are 10 weekly homework assignments (each worth 2%) and `hw11` is optional. All answers will be provided at the end of the term.

- **Project Proposal** (30%)
  - You need to make a project proposal. **You are encouraged to start early**!

- **Project Presentation** (50%)
  - You need to make a presentation on the project and submit the associated reports (or papers), slides, and codes (or demos).
